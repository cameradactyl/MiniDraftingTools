Some Small drafting tools for notebook sketches


These are the STL files for a mini t square and 30 60 90 drafting triangle.  I couldn't find a set of these small enough for making mechanical sketches in my notebook, so I designed and printed them.

30% infill, three shell layers, 0.44mm nozzle, 0.3mm layer height, in PLA on a reprap printer.  Great for making mechanical notebook sketches. 

Requires 2x  5mm long M3 Hex bolts to attach the T square head.
